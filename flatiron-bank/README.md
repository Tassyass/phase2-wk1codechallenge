Transaction Tracker App
A simple ReactJS application that allows you to view a table of transactions, add new transactions, and filter transactions by description. The app fetches transaction data from a db.json file and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements in place:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
A text editor or IDE for code editing (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd transaction-tracker-app
Install project dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Make sure you have a db.json file in your project directory containing transaction data. You can modify this file or replace it with your own data.

Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Transaction Tracker app.

The app will display a table of transactions fetched from db.json.

Use the search bar to filter transactions by description. Only transactions matching the search term will be displayed.

You can also add new transactions using the form (implementation of the form is not included in this README, but it can be added to the App component).
